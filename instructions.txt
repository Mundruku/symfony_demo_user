RUNNING THE DEMO TASK WITH DOCKER

Follow the steps below to build and run the Symfony DEMO TASK project using Docker Compose.

1. Build fresh Docker images
--------------------------------
docker compose build --pull --no-cache


2. Start the Symfony application
--------------------------------
This will set up and start a  Symfony DEMO TASK project and wait until all services are ready.

docker compose up --wait


3. Access the application
--------------------------------
Open the application in your web browser:

https://localhost

You may see a browser warning due to the auto-generated TLS certificate.
This is expected for local development. Please accept the certificate to continue.


4. Stop the Docker containers
--------------------------------
When you are done, stop all containers and remove orphaned services:

docker compose down --remove-orphans

Note: The end points are the same ones picked from the demo guideline
